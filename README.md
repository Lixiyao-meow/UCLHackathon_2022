# UCL API Hackthon 2022 - Crowd Control

A crowd control system using sensors detection via UCL API. Our implementation is based on the a heatmap api based on HTML5 canvas:

Our Crowd Control gives students access to a web application which shows a bird's eye view of UCL, displaying the density of students in certain areas as well as café and restaurant locations on campus (e.g., UCL Print Café). It allows students to navigate towards more sparse areas, thus dispersing students around campus and helping alleviate the overcrowding problem at hand.

# Background

In 2022, UCL reached a record number of students, approximately 50 000. As such, many areas on campus are overcrowded, which can be frustrating for some and overwhelming for others. Students aren't aware of all the different locations on campus, so they only flock to the popular locations, thus unnecessarily creating large crowds of students.
